# RISC-microprocessor-using-Verilog

The ISA of the microprocessor is given with basic R-type
instructions. The basic components of the microprocessor like 
1.Program counter
2.Arithmetic logical unit
3.Register file 
4.Instruction fetch
5.Controller were made module wise and tested using appropriate testbeds.
Finally, the microprocessor was simulated and verified using a testbed.

Verilog file processor is included with all modules.
